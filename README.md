# friend-finder

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The app utilizes Express to handle routing and deployed with Heroku. The survey has 10 questions and each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with the question.
